            Data types are an important topic I might say.
            It is one of the building blocks of knowledge in this spectacular programming language!
            So lets dive into it!
          </p>
          <p>
            There are 8 data types in JavaScript and all of them except 'object' type, are primitives!
            I hear you asking, "What is a primitive type, dear author?" to that my response is; I don't care!<br />
            Here are data types I was talking about:
            <ul>
              <li>string</li>
              <li>number</li>
              <li>bigint</li>
              <li>boolean</li>
              <li>undefined</li>
              <li>null</li>
              <li>symbol</li>
              <li>object</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
